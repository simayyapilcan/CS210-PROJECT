## Introduction 🎬

In this project, we leverage Apple Health data to explore various aspects of personal health and fitness. By analyzing the data, we aim to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations that can provide valuable insights into our well-being.

## Motivation 🚀
Most of us have the health app pre-installed on our mobile phones, However, we do not look in to our data in depth. Also most of the health apps, does not show the entire data visually for the sake of simplicity. Hence, we are limited to insights created by those applications. This project aims to dive deeper into the personal health data and gain insights by applying various techniques.

## Data Source 💿
Apple Health App is used to extract the data. This app has various sources. The main one is my iPhone, others are my Apple Watch and other well-being apps connected to Apple Health app such as YAZIO.

## Data Preprocessing 🤖

Extracted data from the Apple Health App comes as an XML format file. Hence, I used extractor Python file made by community. After extracting all the events as a CSV file, manually checked them for the data sufficiency. Since, data length can vary across different events, manually checking the files seems the bes option to determine the value of the data.

After identifying necessary datas, I started to remove irrelevant columns from the dataset, handle the data formats and converted the  to datetime objects and lastly grouped the session datas daily in order to visualize them properly.

## Data Analysis 🧐

I used exploratory data analysis and visualization techniques to gain insights about my health. Due to inconsistency among the timeframes of the datas made the common date range so narrow that training a ML model would be meaningles due to lack of data.

## Limitations and Future Work 💼

The major problem which constrained my analysis was inconsistency among the data intervals. Until now I did not realized the quality of my health data since the app handles it. However, after I got my hands dirty with the data, I realized that it would be more beneficial If I were checking my health app on regular basis and use it every day to check the success of the data collection and input manual data such as nutritions. Hence, after collecting data every day for one year, I will be able to concatenate all my health data in one dataframe and then make future predictions on my health using various machine learning and ai.
